FILTERS:

Country + State => Location

- Nesting -- Should allow expanding certain places (like US) to filter by state if necessary
- Do we NEED state?
  - Why would location matter in the first place?
    - Shipping costs (distance from them to you)
    - Tarrifs/fees/trade embargos
- INSTEAD:
  - Country selection only
  - Explicitly exclude certain countries -- eg "allow china, block UK"

Parts

- Legs --

Additional/Misc

- "Accepts payment plans" a checkbox
  - You're never going to search for "NO, they don't accept payment plans" -- that's not going to be something someone needs -- remove N
  - Without this, all makers match
  - With this, only makers that explicitly do accept will be shown

Remove "hidden" --- what does this solve for customers?
